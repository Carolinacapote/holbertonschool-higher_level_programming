# 0x07. Python - Test-driven development

## Description

In this repository, you will find 2 different kinds of files. The **.py** files contain functions written in Python language, and the **.txt** files contain the TDD(Test Driven Development) files of these functions that I recently mentioned.

### Features

- The **.txt** files are doctests written to verify the correct work of the code modules. All these files are in the **tests** folder that you can find in this repository.

- The **.txt** test files should be executed like this: `python3 -m doctest ./tests/*`

- The code uses the PEP8 style.

- All the modules and functions have documentation.
